        "description": "The collection of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum extends from the late seventeenth to the early twentieth century and includes approximately twelve thousand examples of furniture, silver, glass, pewter, ceramics, and textiles. Present in the collection are objects made on American soil from the early colonial period, reflecting the settlers&#x27; keen desire to reproduce as faithfully as possible the material world they had left behind in England, Holland, and other homelands. Styles adhered closely to overseas developments, though regional schools of cabinetmaking did emerge rather swiftly in Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Williamsburg, and Charleston. Over the next two centuries, assimilating trends and techniques from across the Atlantic was the major preoccupation of American designers and craftsmen. The department&#x27;s holdings reflect this ongoing dialogue, as well as the many truly original voices in American decorative arts.  The Metropolitan&#x27;s collection of American stained glass is perhaps the most comprehensive anywhere and features the innovative work of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Also noteworthy is the rest of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century glass collection, including objects designed and produced by Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company; early furniture up to about 1820; Baroque-style silver of about 1700; presentation and exposition silver objects of the later nineteenth century; and nineteenth-century ceramics.",

More than one thousand paintings, six hundred sculptures, and 2,600 drawings - exceeding four thousand works in total by approximately nine hundred different artists- constitute an encyclopedic survey of fine art in America, from the late colonial period in the eighteenth century through the early twentieth century. The collection has been assembled over more than a century, beginning almost immediately after the Museum&#x27;s founding. (American paintings, sculpture, and drawings by artists born after 1878 are in the Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, and all photographs in the Department of Photographs.)  Extraordinary in quality and exhaustive in scope, the department&#x27;s collection of paintings has impressive concentrations of portraits, landscapes, and narrative scenes, as well as notable works by America&#x27;s foremost painters, including John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, and John Sloan. The sculpture collection is equally distinguished and is especially strong in Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts works.  Please note that the galleries for American Paintings and Sculpture will reopen in late 2011, following a major renovation. Many of the colonial American paintings are now installed in the period rooms and adjacent decorative arts galleries. Other masterworks remain on view in The Henry R.

The collection of more than seven thousand works of art ranges in date from 8000 B.C. (the Neolithic period) to the Arab conquest and rise of Islam beginning in A.D. 651. The works come from ancient Mesopotamia, Iran, Syria, Anatolia, and other lands in the region that extends from the Black and Caspian Seas in the north to the southwestern Arabian peninsula, and from western Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea to the Indus River Valley in modern-day Pakistan and India. Societies throughout the ancient Near East maintained commercial and cultural contacts across great distances, although the routes, trade goods, and artistic styles and motifs that were exchanged varied in different periods.  Strengths of the department&#x27;s collection, in formation for more than a century, include Sumerian sculptures; Anatolian ivories; Iranian bronzes; metalwork from Bronze Age Bactria in modern-day Afghanistan and Turkmenistan; and magnificent silver and gold vessels from the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras in Iran. These objects are joined by an extraordinary group of Assyrian stone reliefs depicting scenes of warfare and ritual and by enormous guardian figures, all from the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (883&#x2013;859 B.C.) at Nimrud, as well as by fine ivory carvings, many of which originally served as furniture ornaments at that site.

Located on four acres overlooking the Hudson River in northern Manhattan&#x27;s Fort Tryon Park, the building incorporates elements from five medieval French cloisters&#x2014;quadrangles enclosed by a roofed or vaulted passageway, or arcade&#x2014;and from other monastic sites in southern France. Three of the cloisters reconstructed at the branch museum feature gardens planted according to horticultural information found in medieval treatises and poetry, garden documents and herbals, and medieval works of art, such as tapestries, stained-glass windows, and column capitals. Approximately five thousand works of art from medieval Europe, dating from about A.D. 800 with particular emphasis on the twelfth through fifteenth century, are exhibited in this unique and sympathetic context.  The collection at The Cloisters is complemented by more than six thousand objects exhibited in several galleries on the first floor of the Museum&#x27;s main building on Fifth Avenue.

Arguably the preeminent institution of its kind in the world, the matrix of The Costume Institute collection was the Museum of Costume Art, an independent entity formed in 1937. Led by Neighborhood Playhouse founder Irene Lewisohn, the Museum of Costume Art benefited from gifts from Irene Lewisohn and her sister Alice Lewisohn Crowley, as well as from theatrical designers Aline Bernstein and Lee Simonson, among many others. In 1946, with the financial support of the fashion industry, the Museum of Costume Art merged with The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Costume Institute became a department in its own right in 1959. The legendary fashion arbiter Diana Vreeland, who served as special consultant from 1972 until her death in 1989, created a spectacular suite of costume exhibitions, including &#x201C;The World of Balenciaga&#x201D; (1973), &#x201C;Hollywood Design&#x201D; (1974), &#x201C;The Glory of Russian Costume&#x201D; (1976), and &#x201C;Vanity Fair&#x201D; (1977), galvanizing audiences and setting the international standard for the opulent exhibition of costume, chiefly based on loan items.  Today, The Costume Institute&#x27;s five thousand square feet of gallery space, refurbished in 1992, house two special exhibitions a year based on The Costume Institute&#x27;s peerless collection. These exhibitions have achieved the defining stature of the earlier Vreeland exhibitions by developing a critical discourse of fashion.  No other institution in the world has as ambitious a suite of exhibitions on fashion as The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Between exhibitions, The Costume Institute offers a docent-led tour, as well as &#x201C;The Art of Dress,&#x201D; a Family Guide that discusses fashion history within the context of the Museum&#x2019;s vast permanent collection of paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, armor, and textiles.",

Today, virtually the entire collection is on display in thirty-two major galleries and eight study galleries, with objects arranged chronologically. Overall, the holdings reflect the aesthetic values, history, religious beliefs, and daily life of the ancient Egyptians over the entire course of their great civilization.  The Department of Egyptian Art is particularly well known for the Old Kingdom mastaba (offering chapel) of Perneb (ca. 2450 B.C.); a set of Middle Kingdom wooden models from the tomb of Meketre at Thebes (ca. 1990 B.C.); jewelry of Princess Sit-hathor-yunet of Dynasty 12 (ca. 1897&#x2013;1797 B.C.); royal portrait sculpture of Dynasty 12 (ca. 1991&#x2013;1783 B.C.); and statuary of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut of Dynasty 18 (ca. 1473&#x2013;1458 B.C.).

While many of these objects were originally intended for decoration of a mosque or for use during worship, domestic and luxury objects in the collection reveal the mutual influence of artistic practice in the sacred and secular realms. In particular, the traditions of calligraphy, vegetal ornament (the arabesque), and geometric patterning are strongly expressed in most pieces on view.  To dispel a common misconception: Islam&#x27;s supposed prohibition against figural art is confined to the religious sphere. As just one example, many representations of people are to be found in the department&#x27;s outstanding assemblage of miniature paintings&#x2014;strictly secular in nature&#x2014;from the courts of Iran and Mughal India. Other strengths of the Metropolitan&#x27;s collection include ceramics and textiles from all parts of the Islamic world; some of the finest Islamic carpets in existence from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and glass and metalwork from Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia.  The galleries are currently projected to reopen in 2011. While they are closed, important objects from the collection can be seen throughout the Museum in various locations.",

The collection of nearly three thousand works of art, which had been assembled by Mr. Lehman, a longtime Museum trustee, and by his father, Philip, is housed today in The Robert Lehman Wing. The galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, were designed to evoke the ambience of Lehman&#x27;s own house on West 54th Street in New York City, with wall fabrics, draperies, furniture, and rugs that set the objects in an intimate, personal context.  Thanks to Lehman&#x27;s acute connoisseurship and adroit negotiation of the art market, the collection is extremely strong in several areas of European art. Its approximately three hundred paintings favor the Italian Renaissance, especially the Sienese school, and the early northern masters, but range as far afield as the Fauves and beyond. Its more than seven hundred Old Master drawings include a rich trove of eighteenth-century Venetian works as well as other important Italian, French, and northern examples. The remaining two thousand objects in many media in the collection fall into the category of decorative arts; the concentrations of Venetian glass and Renaissance majolica are particularly noteworthy.",

The Metropolitan Museum&#x27;s collection of medieval art, one of the richest in the world, encompasses the art of this long and complex period in all of its many phases, from its pre-Christian antecedents in Western Europe through the early Christian, Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic periods. Though administered by a single curatorial department, the Museum&#x27;s medieval holdings are exhibited in two different locations: in several galleries on the first floor of the Main Building on Fifth Avenue, and at The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan devoted to the art of medieval Europe in northern Manhattan&#x27;s Fort Tryon Park.  The medieval objects in the Main Building, of which there are more than six thousand, display a somewhat broader geographical and temporal range&#x2014;pre-medieval European antiquities (that are not Greek or Roman) from as early as the Bronze Age fall under the department&#x27;s purview and are exhibited here, as are works of Byzantine art from the Middle East and North Africa&#x2014;while the collection of about five thousand objects housed at The Cloisters is strictly European and starts in the year 800, with particular emphasis on the twelfth through the fifteenth century. Both locations exhibit two- and three-dimensional works of art in a wide range of media, from wooden and stone free-standing and architectural sculpture to stained glass, metalwork, enamels, ivories, manuscript illuminations (typically tempera and gold leaf on parchment or vellum), oil paintings, tapestries, and more.  The collection of medieval art exhibited at the Main Building is particularly strong in Byzantine silver, enamels, glass, and ivories; medieval jewelry; Romanesque and Gothic metalwork, stained glass, sculpture, enamels, and ivories; and Gothic tapestries.",

The collection, which is unsurpassed in its comprehensive scope, illustrates the development of musical instruments from all cultures and eras. The instruments, selected for their technical and social importance as well as for their tonal and visual beauty, may be approached in a number of ways: as art objects, as ethnographic record, and as documents of the history of music and performance.  Although the greatest strength of the department lies in its encyclopedic nature, categories that are particularly well represented include European and American keyboards, wind instruments from the late seventeenth through the nineteenth century, and instruments of all sorts from non-Western societies. Fifty highlights from the department are presented online, organized by instrument type and, within types, alphabetically by the name of the country of origin. The basic instrument types, or classifications, are aerophones (which generate sound through the vibration of air), chordophones (through the vibration of strings), membranophones (through the vibration of a stretched membrane), and idiophones (which are made of naturally sonorous materials that require no additional tension to produce sound).

These traits correspond to eating, hearing, and reproduction functions, and each represents an evolutionary branch. Included in this hall are monotremes, marsupials, sloths, and armadillos. Some living animals from these groups, such as the platypus, have so many primitive features that they are called living fossils.",

Up until about 10,000 years ago, mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats, camels, and giant ground sloths roamed across North America. Then, an episode of extinction wiped all those animals out. The cause of this wave of extinction is unclear, but possible explanations include dramatic climate changes at the end of the last ice age, hunting by humans, and infectious disease.",

James Perry Wilson (1889-1976), a master of artful illusion, painted the backgrounds for many of the dioramas at the Museum, including those in the Hall of North American Mammals. In addition to accurately capturing every detail, his paintings evoke the intangible feel of the places they depict. This is owed in part to Wilson&#x27;s dizzyingly precise perspective, one of his signature qualities. In his dioramas the real materials of the foreground merge impeccably with the painted background, uniting the two- and three-dimensional into a seamless whole. Jaguar Diorama  Creating these illusions involved a great deal of research. To prepare the bison diorama, Wilson traveled to Wyoming in 1938 with a scientific specialist and another artist. There Wilson made color sketches, took photographs, and collected specimens for the foreground of the scene.

The hall is named after Carl Akeley (1864-1926), the explorer, conservationist, taxidermist, sculptor, and photographer who conceived of, designed, and collected for the hall. All the mammal dioramas in the Museum were created using his highly refined taxidermy and mounting techniques. The animals have been reconstructed with such scientific accuracy and detail that they appear astoundingly lifelike.

        "description": "The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) has one of the most extensive collections of Native American arts and artifacts in the world&#x2014;approximately 266,000 catalog records (825,000 items) representing over 12,000 years of history and more than 1,200 indigenous cultures throughout the Americas. Ranging from ancient Paleo-Indian points to contemporary fine arts, the collections include works of aesthetic, religious, and historical significance as well as articles produced for everyday use. Current holdings include all major culture areas of the Western Hemisphere, representing virtually all tribes in the United States, most of those of Canada, and a significant number of cultures from Middle and South America and the Caribbean. Approximately 68 percent of the object collections originate in the United States, with 3.5 percent from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico and Central America; 11 percent from South America; and 6 percent from the Caribbean. Overall, 55 percent of the collection is archaeological, 43 percent ethnographic, and 2 percent modern and contemporary arts. (These figures are based on catalog numbers, not number of items, where single catalog numbers encompassing dozens of sherds or projectile points would skew percentages toward archaeology.)  In terms of collections&#x2019; growth, NMAI continues to focus actively on modern and contemporary arts, relying on donations for the expansion of earlier ethnographic collections. Given the 1970 passage of UNESCO regulations controlling antiquities exports from Latin America, and North American Indian peoples&#x2019; continuing ambivalence about archaeology, there is little expectation for substantial growth of the archaeological collections. And although NMAI&#x2019;s enabling legislation encompasses Hawai&#x2019;i, the museum does not accept or collect Native Hawaiian material.  In addition to the object collections, the museum&#x2019;s holdings also include the Photographic Archive (approximately 324,000 images from the 1860s to the present); the Media Archive (approximately 12,000 items) including film and audiovisual collections such as wax cylinders, phonograph discs, 16mm and 35mm motion picture film, magnetic media of many varieties, and optical and digital media recorded from the late 1800s through the present; and the Paper Archive (approximately 1522 linear feet) comprised of records dating from the 1860s to the present that preserve the documentary history of the NMAI, its predecessor, the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation (MAI), and their collections, as well as other documentary and archival materials. Each of these four permanent collections components is defined by its individual scope and described in detail below. NMAI also maintains unaccessioned collections, including educational teaching collections and non-Native works of art depicting American Indian subjects, as well as poorly documented materials currently being researched for their value to the overall collection or potential disposition.  Although maintained as four discrete components, the Object, Photo Archive, Media Archive, and Paper Archive collections are deeply intertwined since each contains items that relate to one another: Photo and Media Archives include images of objects in use in Native communities or excavation contexts and the Paper Archive includes fieldnotes and documentation for all aspects of the combined collections. Through implementation of its Collecting Plan, NMAI hopes to expand the scope of the collections and continue its historically significant work in documenting indigenous lives and perspectives&#x2014;through objects, diverse media, and other means&#x2014;while simultaneously increasing the integration of the collections with one another and making them more applicable to museum programs and accessible to external users.",

Welcome to Hidden Kingdoms-- The World of Microbes. Here you will be able to explore this unseen, fascinating and important realm of life.  Sea of Microbes Look in the aquarium. You see fish and plants. What you don&#x2019;t see are the billions and billions of microbes that also live there. To see these microbes look in the nearby microscopes.  Microbes are at the bottom of the food chain: Microbes eat each other and are eaten by tiny animals, which are larger than microbes, that in turn are eaten by the small fish you see in this tank.  Listen to a guided tour and observe the microscopic world that lives in a drop of pond water. You may even make your own drop-of-water slide and see your organisms projected with our video microscope.  Microbial Zoo There are several different views of microbes in this exhibit. Look at cavorting beasties through the unique, high-quality, easy-view microscopes and see some of the animalcules that were seen for the first time over 300 years ago!

Inside the museum, the first Mercury capsule ever made and flown is also on display.  Atlas/Mercury: The Hall&#x2019;s original Mercury capsule was the first U.S. spacecraft. Designated Mercury # 1, it was launched on May 9, 1960 as part of the beach abort mission testing the Mercury escape system. At the time of this launch the interior of Mercury #1 was fully equipped for space, making it the first spacecraft. The replica of this capsule sits atop of an Atlas rocket, the type used in several of the Mercury missions.  Titan/Gemini: The success of the Mercury program paved the way for Gemini. Named for the astrological twins, Gemini capsules were designed for two-man teams. During the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965Edward H. White became the first American to walk in space. The Titan II rocket is the same type that was used in all of the Gemini missions.",

Over the past century, its collection has continued to grow through generous donations, bequests, and occasional purchases.  The Museum&#x2019;s collection takes center stage in the new permanent exhibition, Collections Central.  Objects in the gallery change frequently to expose visitors to the collection&#x2019;s wide range of cultural artifacts (man-made objects, both ancient and modern, including sculptures, masks, and dolls, as well as everyday household and personal items, such as baskets and combs) and natural science specimens (including minerals, fossils, and mounted birds, mammals, and insects).  Interactive displays challenge visitors to explore objects in new ways, such as using only sense of touch to identify a hidden artifact. Children hunt for object details to solve a six-sided photo puzzle and play a specimen matching game, giving clues to help a partner identify the right rock from a group of minerals.  Families get an up-close look at how different artifacts are made and can become involved in the design process themselves. Children pilot a boat, string beads, and create patterns with decorative tiles, all inspired by cultural artifacts from the collection.

        "description": "Pierpont Morgan took great interest in ancient Near Eastern seals, as is evident from his collection, dating 3500&#x2013;330 B.C. This exhibition displays a number of the best examples of these objects, which are among the earliest known pictorial carvings used to communicate ideas. Created for about three thousand years in the region the ancient Greeks called Mesopotamia, or the land between two rivers, the function of seals was both practical, as a means of identification, and amuletic, intended to protect or benefit the owner in some way. They are among the smallest pictorial objects ever produced&#x2014;often just one inch in size&#x2014;intricately detailed by sculptors who carved them with simple tools in semiprecious stones.  This is the first time that the Morgan&#x27;s collection of seals will be the focus of a theme-based exhibition&#x2014;examining the development of the iconography of power as represented in the cylinder seals from their beginnings in the late fourth millennium B.C. with the emerging temple states through to the great empires of the first millennium B.C. The exhibition will end with the absorption of Mesopotamia into the Persian Empire, along with its ancient iconography, which was subsequently used by the Achaemenid kings until the arrival of Alexander the Great.  In addition to the cylinder seals, a larger-scale statue from the ancient Near East is on view to demonstrate the close relationship between seals and other major artworks. Highlights of the works on view include Nude Bearded Hero Wrestling with Water Buffalo; Bull-Man Fighting Lion (ca. 2334&#x2013;2154 B.C.), an Akkadian period seal depicting two heraldic pairs and emphasizing the concepts of force and power, and A Winged Hero Pursuing Two Ostriches (ca. 12th&#x2013;11th century B.C.), one of the most striking of the Morgan&#x27;s Middle Assyrian seals.",

This emergent research has resulted in new interpretations, delving into the possible evolutionary benefits of non-reproductive sex, for both individuals and social groups.  Set to debut in this exhibition are life-sized animal sculptures custom-made by Rune Olsen. Composed of the social materials of newspaper and tape, these pieces explore the physical world with the immediacy and expressiveness of hand drawing. Through the incorporation of human-like glass eyes, the distance between human and animal vanishes, seducing the viewer into a direct interaction with the gaze of the animal.  In this new natural history the Museum of Sex is presenting an uncensored story of the natural world, moving animal sexuality beyond the confines of reproduction and mating, towards discussions of orientation and cognition. By exploring the most intimate part of life, where it is often said we are most animal like, we can appreciate the significance of research on animal sexuality and, perhaps, extrapolate these concepts to larger issues regarding sexuality in general.",

The galleries are organized according to a set of eight innovative themes, through which visitors can explore historical moments and crucial ideas in American visual culture over the course of nearly three hundred years. Featured within these sections are American masterworks for which the Museum&#x27;s collections have long been known, by such artists and makers as John Singleton Copley, Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Herter Brothers, Union Porcelain Works, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Frank Lloyd Wright, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, William Edmondson, David Smith, Richard Diebenkorn, and Robert Colescott. Visitors are invited to tour the galleries using an audio guide that offers a variety of voices and perspectives, or they may follow the comprehensive program of signage that provides detailed discussions of the gallery themes, individual object labels, and Community Voices labels written by members of the extended Brooklyn Museum community.

Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum&#x2019;s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500&#x2014;an increase of almost 20 percent.  The drawers&#x2019; contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas&#x2014;including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America&#x2014;and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ? Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer&#x2019;s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.  Held in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers.

The section called &#x201C;Painting Land and Sea&#x201D; surveys the formal methods that painters have used to render their physical surroundings across the centuries. &#x201C;Art and Devotion&#x201D; considers the ways in which the artists of the early Renaissance expressed the central tenets of the Catholic faith. &#x201C;Narratives Large and Small&#x201D; shows how artists distill the elements of a story into a single telling moment. Finally, &#x201C;Tracing the Figure&#x201D; charts the enduring artistic interest in the human figure, from portraits that place an individual in a clearly defined place and time to timeless abstractions of the human form.",

        "description": "In April, 2003, the Brooklyn Museum completed the reinstallation of its world-famous Egyptian collection, a process that took ten years. Three new galleries joined the four existing ones that had been completed in 1993 to tell the story of Egyptian art from its earliest known origins (circa 3500 B.C.) until the period when the Romans incorporated Egypt into their empire (30 B.C.&#x2013;A.D. 395). Additional exhibits illustrate important themes about Egyptian culture, including women&#x27;s roles, permanence and change in Egyptian art, temples and tombs, technology and materials, art and communication, and Egypt and its relationship to the rest of Africa. More than 1,200 objects&#x2014; comprising sculpture, relief, paintings, pottery, and papyri&#x2014;are now on view, including such treasures as an exquisite chlorite head of a Middle Kingdom princess, an early stone deity from 2650 B.C., a relief from the tomb of a man named Akhty-hotep, and a highly abstract female terracotta statuette created over five thousand years ago.  The title of the installation refers to a central theme of Egyptian life and to the rebirth of Egyptian art at the Brooklyn Museum. The ancient Egyptians created many of the objects now on view to assist in the process of rebirth from this world to the next. This unifying idea led to an artistic conservatism in Egyptian culture that disguises stylistic changes. The balance between permanence and change is a theme that resonates throughout the installation&#x27;s seven galleries.",

        "description": "These twelve massive carved alabaster panels, on view together for the first time, dominate the walls of the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Hagop Kevorkian Gallery of Ancient Middle Eastern Art. Originally brightly painted, they once adorned the vast palace of King Ashur-nasir-pal II (883&#x2013;859 B.C.), one of the greatest rulers of ancient Assyria. Completed in 879 B.C. at the site of Kalhu (modern Nimrud, slightly north of what is now Baghdad, Iraq), the palace was decorated by skilled relief-carvers with these majestic images of kings, divinities, magical beings, and sacred trees.  How the Reliefs Came to Brooklyn  In 879 B.C., King Ashur-nasir-pal II celebrated the completion of his palace at Kalhu by hosting a banquet for 69,574 guests, but the glorious palace was soon abandoned and forgotten. In 1840, nearly three thousand years later, a young English diplomat named Austen Henry Layard noticed an unusually large mound while rafting down the Tigris River. He returned in 1845 to unearth the remains of the palace, sending his discoveries to the British Museum in London. He sent so many monumental sculptures and relief-decorated slabs that the museum sold some of them, including these twelve reliefs. In 1855, the expatriate American Henry Stevens purchased the reliefs and shipped them to Boston. Unable to raise funds for the reliefs there, he sold them to James Lenox for the New-York Historical Society. In 1937, the Society lent them to the Brooklyn Museum and in 1955, Hagop Kevorkian, the New York collector and dealer, donated the funds to purchase and install the reliefs in the renamed Hagop Kevorkian Gallery of Ancient Middle Eastern Art at the Brooklyn Museum.  Other objects in the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Ancient Near Eastern collection include works made by the Sumerians, Assyrians, Achaemenid Persians, Sabeans, and others. Art from this region served several purposes. Some objects, like the twelve reliefs installed along the walls of the Kevorkian gallery, were meant to impress and overpower viewers. Figures of gods, in both human and animal form, were worshiped in temples. A few objects, especially small animal sculptures, seem to have been made simply to be enjoyed and appreciated. Though each culture had its own artistic tradition, they frequently borrowed themes and styles from one another. Certain subjects became standard throughout the Near East and were repeated for centuries. For more than four thousand years, artists living in what are now Iran, Iraq, and Turkey fashioned images of supernatural beings combining human and animal characteristics, for example.",

It presents more than one hundred masterpieces from these extraordinary holdings, representing China, Korea, Japan, India, Southeast Asia and the Himalayas, and the Islamic world.  The Chinese gallery at the Museum features more than 100 objects that cover more than five thousand years of Chinese culture and civilization, from neolithic times to the present. Current interest focuses on China&#x27;s diversity as well as its cultural and artistic connections with neighbors. Many objects also demonstrate the ways in which Chinese culture has, throughout history, looked back at earlier traditions as a sign of enduring respect for the past.  Korean culture is often presented in connection with China and other East Asian cultures. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s presentation of its Korean collection emphasizes Korea&#x27;s unique traditions, culture, and aesthetics.  Japanese art forms the largest area within the Asian art collection at the Brooklyn Museum. In addition to the traditional arts of Japan, the galleries include a section devoted to contemporary Japanese ceramics by renowned masters and the younger generation of artists who are currently active in Japan. Japanese folk art is represented, as is a selection of artifacts from our renowned collection of Ainu culture.  The South Asian collection includes works from cultures defined by their geographical proximity to the Indian subcontinent, ranging in date from prehistory to the present. The Museum&#x27;s outstanding India terracotta collection is represented. Basic religious tenets constitute an overarching theme throughout the cultures of South and Southeast Asia. The sculptures and architectural components on display were largely created as religious icons or embellishments for the walls of religious buildings. Outside the religious sphere, courtly traditions, such as Mughal (1526&#x2013;1756) decorative arts produced in India, are also a strength of the Museum&#x27;s collection.  The Islamic collection is encyclopedic in representation and contains a renowned, comprehensive group of later Persian art of the Qajar period (1779&#x2013;1924), which is one of the finest outside Iran. Well-represented among the Islamic holdings are medieval Islamic ceramics, the arts of Safavid Iran, Ottoman Turkish ceramics and textiles, Turkmen costumes and jewelry, and North African textiles, costumes and jewelry. The permanent galleries display approximately 100 works drawn from all periods of Islamic Art, and feature regular rotations of light-sensitive material. Complementary didactic materials and educational programming in the galleries are designed to reach the Museum&#x27;s many audiences, including the vibrant, diverse Muslim community, which is an important local Brooklyn constituency.",

Additional related art from ancient Egypt and Islamic North Africa can be found in the second- and third-floor galleries. The art on view in the first-floor galleries ranges from ancient Nubian pottery and sculpture, Berber jewelry, and West African masks to East African beadwork, Ethiopian processional crosses, and a contemporary ceramic vessel by the Kenya-born artist Magdalene Odondo. The main focus of the African collections is on sculpture from West and Central Africa.  The gallery is arranged geographically, as if the viewer were moving across Africa&#x2014;first from west to east and then, as the gallery turns, from north to south. The gallery seeks to celebrate the creative artistic genius of African artists by presenting exceptional examples of their work. At the same time it tries to help the viewer understand the cultural context in which these pieces were made and used. The groupings reflect stylistic relationships among objects produced in individual cultures as well as relationships among the diverse cultures found in Africa. Labels and panels describe the role that art plays in African life, while photographs and videos illustrate how, in many of these societies, art continues to transmit the traditions and values that have sustained African peoples for thousands of years.  Among the most famous pieces on view in the gallery are a figure of a hornblower, cast in brass for the king of Benin in the 16th century, and an ivory gong also made for the royal court in Benin at about the same time. A seventeenth-century figure of a Kuba king is the only one from that period in North America, and a Luluwa mother-and-child figure is world-renowned. The gallery also shows textiles, ceramics, jewelry, masks, and figures from more than 50 different cultures.",

Feinberg Entrance. Most of these remarkable objects date to the period between 1880 and 1910, recording a great era in the cultural, architectural, and industrial history of New York City.  Beyond the significance of individual works, the collection as a whole demonstrates the Museum&#x27;s agile response to the destruction of architectural treasures even before the historic preservation movement reached its stride in the late 1960s. As public appreciation of architectural ornament and sculpture has grown, the Museum&#x27;s collection has served not only as an archive of historic objects, but also as a welcoming outdoor installation beloved by visitors.  Recognizing the importance of these two functions, the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s 1986 Master Plan features the collection installation as a primary outdoor Museum space to be developed, a complement to the public plaza on Eastern Parkway.  Original works of art in the reconfigured and revitalized garden invite visitors to the Museum as they approach the Norman M. Feinberg Entrance, adjacent to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. A later phase will extend installation of the architectural collection into the Eastern Parkway plaza area as well.  These projects, which include rich interpretative programs introducing the history and context of the collection, exemplify the Museum&#x27;s mission to serve the public as a dynamic and rewarding destination.  The reconfiguration of the Museum&#x27;s outdoor spaces also includes the renovation and reorientation of the Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway stop. Within the train station, an exciting display of historic New York architectural ornaments invites visitors into the newly designed public plaza.  The MTA station project presents an important yet uncelebrated collection, increasing public awareness and appreciation of New York&#x27;s architectural richness, while also illustrating that great art is not limited to the inside of the Museum.",

The dense display of objects in the Visible Storage ? Study Center offers you an inside look at how museums work and provides a glimpse of the breadth and scope of the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s extensive American collections. As huge as the Museum&#x27;s building is, just a small fraction of the permanent collections can be displayed in its limited exhibition gallery space. Whereas only about 350 works are on view in the adjacent American Identities exhibition, this facility gives open access to some 2,000 of the many thousands of American objects held in storage, which are now available for viewing and research by students, scholars, and the general public.  The Visible Storage ? Study Center is a working Museum facility as much as other storerooms throughout the building that are not open to the public. As in the closed storerooms, the works held in Visible Storage are available for study, and maintained under proper conditions of temperature, humidity, and light levels. Two large, glass-walled bays in the Visible Storage ? Study Center contain nearly six hundred paintings from the permanent collection on rolling racks; the selection on view will be periodically rotated to provide an ever-changing array from the collection&#x27;s holdings. Large glass vitrines also put on view the majority of the Museum&#x27;s collection of historic (that is, pre-1945) American sculpture. Other vitrines contain a selection of objects from the American decorative arts collection: pewter, commemorative pressed glass, Tiffany glass and lamps, examples of contemporary industrial design and furniture, silver, eighteenth-century furniture, nineteenth-century seating furniture with original upholstery, and Brooklyn-made ceramics. There are also representative displays of Native American and Spanish colonial objects. Three areas are devoted to small special exhibitions that change periodically and provide focused examinations of different art historical themes or aspects of the permanent collections.  Although this is an operating storage facility rather than a conventional exhibition gallery, the exhibition planning team has designed it to welcome you and orient you to the resources in the facility. Selected focus objects are displayed on colored shelves, with texts offering additional information in booklets hanging from the cases. You will find focus objects in the cases, on the screens of paintings, and in small special exhibitions that highlight rotating selections of works on paper, decorative arts, paintings, and sculpture. There is also a searchable database, available in the Visible Storage ? Study Center and online, with detailed information about the objects.

        "description": "Ranging from preparatory studies and sketches to finished works of art, the nearly twelve thousand drawings in The Morgan Library &amp; Museum&#x27;s collection span the fourteenth through twenty-first centuries. The primary focus is European drawings executed before 1825, but the Morgan&#x27;s holdings include a growing number of nineteenth- and twentieth-century works on paper as well as drawings by American artists. In addition to a print collection of British political satires and portraits, about two hundred paintings, sculptures, medieval reliquaries, and ceramics, the Morgan has the largest and most representative collection of Rembrandt etchings in the United States  In 1909 Pierpont Morgan established the core of the Morgan&#x27;s holdings when he purchased a collection of about fifteen hundred old master drawings from the English artist-collector Charles Fairfax Murray. Its strengths&#x2014;notably sixteenth- and eighteenth-century Italian drawings and Netherlandish drawings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&#x2014;remain unsurpassed in the United States. Since the founding of the Morgan as a public institution, the most important factor in the growth of the collection has been the acquisition of individual works and entire collections through gifts and bequests.  Italian drawings comprise nearly three thousand individual sheets as well as drawings in albums and sketchbooks, including works by Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci. French drawings are a major strength, with drawings by Claude, Fragonard, and Watteau. Works by Ingres, Delacroix, Degas, C&#xE9;zanne, and Matisse have strengthened the Morgan&#x27;s holdings in works by nineteenth- and twentieth-century draftsmen. British drawings comprise more than one thousand individual sheets as well as albums and sketchbooks. Hogarth, Gainsborough, Blake, Turner, Constable, and Burne-Jones are only a few of the distinguished draftsmen represented in the collection. The Morgan&#x27;s holdings include more than seven hundred works by Netherlandish, Dutch, and Flemish artists, such as Rembrandt, Goltzius, Rubens, and van Dyck.

Since Morgan&#x27;s death in 1913, the collection has more than doubled. Spanning some ten centuries of Western illumination, it includes more than eleven hundred manuscripts as well as papyri. To this should be added the Glazier, Heineman, B&#xFC;hler, Stillman, and Wightman manuscripts, which include more than two hundred more items. Although the collection was formed to illustrate the history of manuscript illumination and includes significant masterpieces from the ninth to sixteenth centuries, there are also some important textual manuscripts.  The Morgan&#x27;s collection is made up primarily of Western manuscripts, with French being the largest single national group, followed by Italian, English, German, Flemish, Dutch, and Spanish. There are also examples of Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopian, Arabic, Persian, and Indian manuscripts. More than fifty Coptic manuscripts from Hamouli, Egypt, nearly all of which were found in their original bindings, form the oldest and most important group of Sahidic manuscripts from a single provenance, the Monastery of St. Michael at S&#xF4;pehes.  The majority of these books are of a religious nature, but the collection also includes important classical works, scientific manuscripts dealing with astronomy and medicine, and practical works on agriculture, hunting, and warfare. Notable are the ninth-century bejeweled Lindau Gospels, the tenth-century Beatus, the Hours of Catherine of Cleves, and the celebrated Hours of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the best-known Italian Renaissance manuscript.",

Areas of exceptional strength include incunables, early children&#x27;s books, fine bindings, and illustrated books.  The collection&#x27;s strong base derives from the major acquisitions of Pierpont Morgan, who sought to establish in the United States a library worthy of the great European collections. It is rich in special and unique copies, first editions of classical authors, and works of notable printers, such as Jenson and Caxton. Among the highlights are three Gutenberg Bibles, a strong collection of works by Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, John Ruskin, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and William Morris, and classic early children&#x27;s books. The Carter Burden Collection of American Literature, a major 1998 gift, strengthens the Morgan&#x27;s twentieth-century holdings with authors such as Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, Vladimir Nabokov, Gertrude Stein, and Tennessee Williams.  There are many beautiful and important bindings in the Morgan, but the bindings collection comprises about a thousand volumes acquired primarily to document the development of bookbinding.

The handwritten documents in the collection preserve the process of human thought and creativity&#x2014;from mind to pen to paper&#x2014;with an immediacy and power lacking in texts produced electronically.  The general pattern of the collection was established by Pierpont Morgan, who began to acquire literary and historical manuscripts on a large scale during the 1890s. He sought not to achieve comprehensiveness in any particular field but rather to assemble important documents related to events of historical significance, lives of notable individuals, and the creation of great literary works. By his death in 1913, he had gathered a number of exceptional documents handwritten or signed by influential figures in Western culture, including Elizabeth I, the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Napol&#xE9;on, Sir Isaac Newton, and Voltaire. Morgan had a great interest in major British writers; a centerpiece of his collection was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;the sole surviving manuscript of John Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost, transcribed and corrected under the direction of the blind poet. Other collection highlights are Charles Dickens&#x27;s manuscript of A Christmas Carol, Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s journals, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s letters to his daughter Martha, and manuscripts and letters of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront&#xEB;, Lord Byron, Wilkie Collins, Albert Einstein, John Keats, Abraham Lincoln, and John Steinbeck.  The Morgan&#x27;s collection of literary and historical manuscripts has been enriched by many gifts and acquisitions, and twentieth-century holdings have increased significantly. The collection, particularly strong in artists&#x27; letters, was greatly enhanced by the Pierre Matisse Gallery Archives, the gift of the Pierre Matisse Foundation in 1997. These archives include more than fifteen hundred letters as well as records of the gallery installations of Balthus, Chagall, Dubuffet, Giacometti, Mir&#xF3;, and other twentieth-century artists. The Carter Burden Collection of American Literature includes important manuscripts and correspondence of John Cheever, Ezra Pound, and Tennessee Williams. The 1999 acquisition of The Paris Review Archive added correspondence, interviews, typescripts, and revised proofs of several hundred post-World War II writers, including Donald Hall, Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Toni Morrison, George Plimpton, Philip Roth, and Anne Sexton. The Paris Review Archive also includes audio recordings of interviews with major twentieth-century authors.",

These engraved objects provide a continuous artistic and chronological sequence of more than three thousand years. The seals collection covers all the significant styles of Mesopotamian engraving from the end of the fifth millennium B.C. to the fourth century B.C. as well as most of the styles of other countries of the ancient Near East. Areas of particular strength include seals of the second millennium B.C. made outside southern Mesopotamia (Cappadocia, Syria, and Mitannia) as well as Old Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian seals. The Middle Assyrian seals are among the finest in any collection.

The value of this collection lies not only in the significance and beauty of the works but in the degree to which they represent the art Morgan acquired during the last twenty years of his life. The chronological span is impressive, ranging from early Mesopotamian and Egyptian through Greco-Roman culture, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and beyond. Art of the ancient world is represented by Near Eastern figurines, Egyptian statuettes, and a Roman bronze statue of Eros. Morgan had an extensive collection of Qing porcelain. A Chinese bronze vessel and a fine oxblood vase remain at the Morgan.  The core of the collection, a small but precious hoard of medieval pieces, reflects Morgan&#x27;s immense interest in the art of this period, evident in the Morgan&#x27;s great collection of illuminated manuscripts. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the Stavelot Triptych, the Malmesbury Ciborium, the Basin reliquary, and Lichtenthal Casket remained at the Library. Also represented are masterpieces in Renaissance and baroque art. Although Morgan collected some very fine old master paintings by Hans Memling and Perugino, he seems to have focused on the plastic arts. Examples include miniatures on ivory, Lucas Cranach&#x27;s roundel portraits of Martin Luther and his wife, and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child by the fifteenth-century Florentine sculptor Antonio Rossellino.",

        "description": "Permanently MAD: Revealing the Collection presents approximately 250 works from the Museum of Arts and Design&#x2019;s permanent collection. For the first time in the Museum&#x2019;s 52-year history, dedicated collections galleries introduce visitors to the phenomenal ceramic, glass, wood, metal, fiber, and mixed media works in the Museum&#x2019;s collections. Many of the pieces are on view for the first time.  Permanently MAD offers new ways of looking at artworks, outside of traditional hierarchies of art, craft, and design. Exhibition sections allow viewers to draw connections between works of all media, presenting fresh insights for those familiar with the Museum and for those visiting for the first time. In &#x201C;Description: Seeing the Object,&#x201D; viewers are encouraged to explore artworks visually, through the language of form, color, and surface patterning. In &#x201C;Intention: The Artist Speaks,&#x201D; each object reflects a specific world view, emotion, or imaginative viewpoint of the artist. Finally, &#x201C;Reflection: Objects in Context&#x201D; explores the ways in which the objects are influenced by the environment&#x2014;physical, historical, or social&#x2013;-in which they were created.  The artists in the show demonstrate a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. Sam Maloof is considered one of the leading figures of the Studio Craft Movement, helping to bring back an emphasis on hand-crafting wood furniture. His signature rocker is celebrated as a hallmark of classic design.  An emphasis on the handmade is also a concern for Harumi Nakashima and Myra Mimlitsch-Gray. Nakashima builds coiled domes and then cuts them open, to reveal the interiors and to manipulate the shapes. Mimlitsch-Gray integrates humor and irony in her teapot, by raising a sheet of pure silver with a hammer and anvil to echo the liquid appearance of melting metal.  Judith Schaechter&#x2019;s stained glass offers a whimsical, fantastical look at a parade of creatures. She uses traditional stained-glass techniques, while relying on computer technology to help her sketch and design the composition. Ayala Serfaty&#x27;s use of transparent glass filaments along with a polymer covering demonstrates cutting-edge technology and an innovative aesthetic.  The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated, 250-page catalogue with 200 highlights from the collection. Organized alphabetically by artist, the catalogue includes beautiful new photography, as well as a curator&#x2019;s statement for each object. The catalogue features a timeline of the Museum&#x2019;s history, along with an index by material. It functions as a guidebook to the collection and to the Museum, both for casual readers and scholars.  Permanently MAD: Revealing the Collection is made possible, in part, through the generosity of the Collectors Circle, one of the Museum&#x27;s leadership support groups.",

This vibrant two-floor exhibition features 800 works from the Museum&#x27;s remarkably diverse collection of art, archaeology, ceremonial objects, video, photographs, interactive media and television excerpts. It examines the Jewish experience as it has evolved from antiquity to the present, over 4,000 years, and asks two vital questions: How has Judaism been able to thrive for thousands of years across the globe, often in difficult and even tragic circumstances? What constitutes the essence of Jewish identity?  The exhibition traces the dynamic interaction among three catalysts that have shaped the Jewish experience: the constant questioning and reinterpretation of Jewish traditions, the interaction of Jews and Judaism with other cultures, and the impact of historical events that have transformed Jewish life. Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey proposes that Jews have been able to sustain their identity, despite wide dispersion and sometimes tragic circumstances, by evolving a culture that can adapt to life in many countries and under various conditions. Survival as a people has depended upon both the continuity of Jewish ideas and values and the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.  We invite you to visit the Museum and see Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey in person. Visitors to the Museum can enjoy random access audio guide tours of the exhibition, including a Director&#x27;s Highlights audio guide featuring Joan Rosenbaum, Helen Goldsmith Menschel Director of The Jewish Museum, and a special audio guide for children and families.

Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Willem de Kooning, and Ed Ruscha are just a few of the American innovators on view in this presentation of works from the Whitney&#x27;s collection. This exhibition highlights four broad themes that underscore the key developments of twentieth-century art in America: Form Building, Form Breaking, City and Machine, The Figure and Its Realities, and Mind, Body, Gesture. While these developments are grounded in historical periods, their qualities and ideas also overlap and connect, extending into the work of living artists who found new ways to apply them to creative expression.",

        "description": "In 1902, owning more treasures than his Madison Avenue home could hold, Pierpont Morgan commissioned Charles Follen McKim (1847&#x2013;1909) to build a library for them. McKim was regarded as the dean of American architecture; his style infused classical discipline with measured grandeur and opulence, and he proposed to build Morgan an Italianate marble library that would pay architectural tribute to the High Renaissance. In 2006, a century after its completion, the McKim building has remained little changed since Morgan&#x27;s day. Both the exterior and interior of the original building are designated New York City Landmarks; the secretary of the interior has designated the library a national historic landmark.  Rotunda The interior of the McKim building consists of three rooms radiating off the east, north, and west sides of the Rotunda, a vaulted entrance foyer. The restrained simplicity of the building&#x27;s fa&#xE7;ade yields to the splendor of color and texture in the Rotunda, supplied by variegated marble surfaces and columns, mosaic panels, and columns of lapis lazuli. The marble floor, with its central porphyry disc, owes its design to that of the Villa Pia in the Vatican gardens. The decorative programs for the apse, ceiling, and lunettes of the Rotunda were designed and executed by Harry Siddons Mowbray.  Mr. Morgan&#x27;s Study The Study is the most sumptuous and yet personal of the rooms and the one that best reflects the personal tastes of its original occupant. It was here that Morgan met with art dealers, scholars, business colleagues, and friends. With few exceptions, all the paintings, sculpture, and decorative objects in the Study where here in Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s day. The paintings are primarily by Italian and Northern Renaissance masters; the objects d&#x27;art range in date from the third millennium B.C. to the nineteenth century, and give some indication of the original scope and diversity of Morgan&#x27;s once vast holdings.  Mr. Morgan&#x27;s Library The Library is by far the largest and grandest of the rooms in the McKim building. This room, with its triple tiers of bookcases fashioned of bronze and inlaid Circassian walnut, originally housed most of Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s books. Above the fireplace is a sixteenth-century Brussels tapestry. Harry Siddons Mowbray&#x27;s ceiling paintings feature portraits of great men of the past alternating with female muses and signs of the zodiac.  Librarian&#x27;s Office Now open to the public for the first time, the Librarian&#x27;s Office is located at the north end of the Rotunda. This is the smallest of the McKim rooms and was the office of Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan&#x27;s personal librarian, a leading figure in the international art world, and the first director of the Morgan. In addition to a number of original furnishings, the Librarian&#x27;s Office contains, among other objects, a bronze candelabrum with figures of Juno, Minerva, and Venus by Antoine-Louis Barye, and a bronze sculpture of John Ruskin by Gutzon Borglum. The bronze bust over the mantle, formerly thought to be of Petrarch, has recently been identified as Boccacio, and was made after a marble bust by Giovanni Francesco Rustici. The ceiling paintings are by James Wall Finn and his studio.",

The expansion project is represented by drawings, models, and photographs.  The exhibition is organized by The Morgan Library &amp; Museum and the Renzo Piano Building Workshop and features materials from the conceptual design phase to the finished scheme.  The Renzo Piano Building Workshop&#x27;s project for the Morgan follows an exceptional architectural legacy. The original library, designed by Charles McKim and opened for Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s personal use a hundred years ago, is an American Renaissance icon. Of the numerous structures that once stood on the site now occupied by the Morgan, three remain: the Morgan house, the 1928 Annex, and McKim&#x27;s masterpiece. Renzo Piano reckoned with these three landmarks as he brought practical and pleasing coherence to the complex. This installation is in three parts. The development of the Morgan&#x27;s current property is traced from its beginning in the 1850s. It is not a static building history. Structures were put up, added to, altered, demolished&#x2014;whatever their owners deemed necessary or desirable. The second part examines how Renzo Piano realized the Morgan&#x27;s institutional goals and rationalized and developed the complex that he first encountered in 2000. The final section examines aspects of design development, and images of finished work link architectural drawings to completed construction.",

The central element of the exhibition On the Streets: New York&#x27;s Trolleys and Buses is a simulated traffic intersection complete with traffic lights and coordinated walk-don&#x27;t walk signs, parking meters, fire hydrants, and an array of other street furniture.

Exhibition sidebars credit two men who were instrumental in the electrification of streetcars and railcars. Frank Julian Sprague (1857 &#x2013; 1934), of European descent, often called the father of electric railway traction was responsible for the first large-scale successful use of electricity to run an entire system of streetcars in Richmond, Virginia, in 1887-1888; and Granville T. Woods (1856 &#x2013; 1910), an African-American inventor who patented more than 60 devices over 30 years that sped development of telegraphs, telephones, and electric trains. One of Woods&#x27; most significant inventions, a third-rail system for conducting electric power to railway cars &#x2013; successfully demonstrated in 1892 in Coney Island &#x2013; made the subway a reality in New York City. The exhibition also tells the story of Elizabeth Jennings Graham (1830 &#x2013; 1901), an African-American schoolteacher who won a landmark legal decision that defined the rights of people of color to ride any public conveyance on the city&#x27;s streets. Ms. Graham&#x27;s victory occurred 100 years before Rosa Parks won a U.S. Supreme Court case in the 1950s, that gave African-Americans the right to sit anywhere in a public bus.",

These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.  Special commissions were an important part of Tiffany&#x2019;s businesses. Many of his clients were wealthy, socially-prominent families seeking unique objects and interiors for their lavish homes.

The Panorama was built by a team of 100 people working for the great architectural model makers Raymond Lester Associates in the three years before the opening of the 1964 World&#x2019;s Fair. In planning the model, Lester Associates referred to aerial photographs, insurance maps, and a range of other City material; the Panorama had to be accurate, indeed the initial contract demanded less than one percent margin of error between reality and the model. The Panorama was one of the most successful attractions at the &#x2018;64 Fair with a daily average of 1,400 people taking advantage of its 9 minute simulated helicopter ride around the City.  In 2006 an up-grade of the lighting system - the first change to the model since 1992 - allowed for the Panorama to be displayed in different light conditions; highlight different buildings or areas of the City; and even recreate the sounds of the city. And, in the Spring of 2009 the Museum launched its Adopt-A-Building program with the installation of the Panorama&#x2019;s newest addition, Citi Field, to continue for the ongoing care and maintenance of this beloved treasure.",

What began as New Amsterdam, a rather insignificant Dutch outpost, became New York in 1664. Under English rule the city took on greater importance as part of Britain&#x27;s vast trade system and as a strategic military base for conflicts with France for control of North America. By 1771 the city&#x27;s population stood at over 20,000. In 1785 the Continental Congress selected New York as its meeting site. During this time Fraunces Tavern served as offices for the Departments of War, Treasury, and Foreign Affairs. With the adoption of the Constitution, the city became the first Federal capital in 1789. The following year the capital moved temporarily to Philadelphia. By that time New York was well on its way to becoming, if not the political center of the nation, America&#x27;s capital of commerce and culture.  In addition to numerous maps, prints, and newspapers, the Museum owns such rare pieces of New York&#x27;s past as a panel from Washington&#x27;s inaugural coach and a large, wooden water pipe.",

        "description": "The Mishkin Gallery presents The Work, an exhibition of paintings by Lise Soskolne unfolding in two chapters. The first opens on Friday, May 17, 6 to 8 pm and closes on June 21; the second opens on Monday, June 24, 6 to 8 pm and closes on July 12.  For most of the past two decades, Soskolne&#x2019;s painting practice has been undertaken without a viewing public and concurrent with her work as an administrator and labor organizer in New York&#x2019;s nonprofit arts sector. The Work, her first public solo exhibition in New York since 2001, brings together more than thirty paintings made between 1999 and 2016. Most have never before been shown or have not been on view since their initial presentation.  The Work&#x2019;s first chapter triangulates themes related to time, labor, and gender in a series of paintings that alternate between the faithful application of paint with brushes and the use of tools intended to obliterate the painter&#x2019;s mark. Documenting the stylistic range of Soskolne&#x2019;s earlier work and tendency to engage her subjects with sardonic humor, chapter one sets the stage for Bethenny, the exhibition&#x2019;s second iteration. In a tightly focused series of fourteen densely worked paintings made between 2011 and 2016, Bethenny pictures a sedated moon surrounded by his attendant hallucinations and doubles as a portrait of the distinctly American capacity for self-delusion.  About the Artist: Born in Toronto, Canada, in 1971, Lise Soskolne has lived and worked in New York since the late 1990s. She is a co-founder of Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.) and has been its core organizer since 2012. W.A.G.E. is a New York&#x2013;based activist organization whose mission is to establish sustainable economic relationships between artists and the institutions that contract their labor, and to introduce mechanisms for self-regulation into the art field that collectively bring about a more equitable distribution of its economy. Her work has been exhibited at Artists Space (NY), Diorama (Oslo), The Middler (NY), Modern Culture (NY), Or Gallery (Vancouver), Rodney Graham Studio (Vancouver), and White Columns (NY).   The Work has been curated by Alaina Claire Feldman, the director of the Mishkin Gallery. Baruch College and the George and Mildred Weissman School of Arts and Sciences generously provide support for this exhibition.  Our free exhibition is on view from May 17 &#x2014; July 12, 2019, Mondays - Fridays 11am-6pm, Thursdays 11am-7pm. Our opening reception is on Friday, May 17th, 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm.

One of the founding era&#x27;s key political figures, Hamilton&#x27;s influence on our fledgling country&#x27;s early finances set the wheels in motion for the United States to become the economic super-power it is today laying the foundations for the U.S. capitalist system. This exhibition traces Hamilton&#x27;s life from his birth into poverty in the Caribbean through his rise to military and political greatness in America, becoming America&#x27;s premier economic thinker. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, he saved the new nation&#x27;s credit, established plans for funding our new country&#x27;s debt, created a national bank, and used the tax system to encourage economic development &#x2013; all ideas considered radical by most Americans of the time. Hamilton also founded the Bank of New York, New York City&#x27;s first bank that was located at 48 Wall Street until 1998.  The Museum&#x27;s Alexander Hamilton Room was designed in the federalist style in 1927 to pay tribute to the Walton House, where the Bank of New York first conducted business in 1784. The room originally served as the bank president&#x27;s office.  In this gallery, visitors will see documents signed by Alexander Hamilton, examples of his published works, and items such as medals and currency designed in his honor.",

Works in nearly all media are found in the collection including painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography, works on paper, furniture, metals, textiles, maps, industrial objects and ephemera.  In addition to paintings and a small selection of sculpture, the Museum houses a body of objects that relate to local history, including a collection of glass and ceramic works by the American Pottery Company and the Jersey Glass Company. Our industrial collection features advertisements and other ephemera produced by industries that were based here during the nineteenth century. Two of the collection&#x27;s most prominent and interesting historic local artists include landscape painter August Will and pictorial photographer William Armbruster. Both men made detailed studies of the local landscape, carefully documenting local life and the environment of Jersey City in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Coinciding with the Museum&#x27;s mandate to interpret and display the work of under-represented artists from various American communities, the Museum&#x27;s collection of contemporary art reflects a commitment to collecting work by African American, Asian and Latino artists. Artists who were active in the New York art scene of the 1980s and 1990s are reflected in the collection, as are their less familiar colleagues who made their homes in New Jersey. Works by both emerging and established artists add to the collection&#x27;s strength as it upholds the institution&#x27;s role as the most notable contemporary art museum in New Jersey. As a whole, the collection reflects the Museum&#x27;s attempt to build a display cabinet that acknowledges the significance of Jersey City&#x27;s industrial history, its ever-changing social and economic landscape, and the infusion of immigrants that make its community unique.",

The experience is powered by Microsoft AI technology and explores powerful feelings of hope, anger, joy, and determination. Feel the Pride is an immersive experience that takes guests on a journey through the feelings behind Pride. First, users share what Pride means to them &#x2014; either at the installation or on Twitter using #FeelThePride.

Sounds by St. Vincent and a colorful lighting display evolve based on the sentiment of each message, representing the global community&#x2019;s feelings about Pride. Once guests have experienced the installation, they have the opportunity to take action through signing up online to volunteer, learn more, or donate through LGBTQI&#x2B; activist organization GLAAD.  Feel The Pride will run from June 15&#x2013;30, located at 568 Broadway (at Prince St), New York. More information can be found at theallycoalition.org/pride.",

Ryan Wilson).  ThankYouX began his artistic journey on the streets of Los Angeles, spray painting stencils in homage to Andy Warhol. While those stencils were his initial calling card, gaining him a significant cult following - as well as celebrity fans from Demi Moore to Paul McCartney - they only scratched the surface of his multifaceted artistic identity. As his notoriety grew to international acclaim, the scope of his expression evolved to contemporary abstract images that stand in striking contrast to the more conventional graffiti-inspired street-art paradigm.  ThankYouX went on to exhibit paintings and sculptures in London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Hong Kong. But he has more recently attracted the attention of the art world cognoscenti with his mixed media cube paintings and large scale abstract work.  But 2019 finds him introducing his work to entirely new audiences. Indeed, he&#x27;ll be in Biarritz, France on June 12 for his collaboration with Indian Motorcycles - along with fellow artists including Risk and D Face. And following that, ThankYouX arrives in New York for a solo exhibition and opening night reception on June 20, at the BlackBook Presents gallery in DUMBO, Brooklyn.  ThankYouX&#x2019;s work is collected by Elon Musk, Zedd, Paul McCartney, Wiz Khalifa, Drew Taggert (The Chainsmokers), Evan Spiegel (CEO, Snapchat), Lil Jon and Miley Cyrus, amongst others.  &#xFEFF;Ryan Wilson is from Huntington Beach, California and lives in Los Angeles with his wife.",
